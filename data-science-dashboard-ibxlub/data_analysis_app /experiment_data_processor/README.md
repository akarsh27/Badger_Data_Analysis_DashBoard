## Introduction

Welcome to the technical documentation for our Scientific Data Analysis Web Application. This document provides an in-depth look at the technologies, architecture, and implementation details of our project.

## Overview

Our web application is designed to streamline the process of importing, analyzing, and presenting scientific data. It provides researchers and scientists with a user-friendly platform to manage experimental data efficiently.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Python**: Used for backend logic, data processing, and server-side scripting.
- **Django**: Python-based web framework for building the application's backend.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database management system for storing scientific data.

### Frontend

- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend markup and styling for the web application.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting for enhancing user interactivity.
- **jQuery**: Simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **DataTables**: JavaScript library for displaying tabular data in an interactive format.

## Architecture

The application follows a typical Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

- **Model**: Defined in `models.py`, includes database models for storing scientific data.
- **View**: Implemented in `views.py`, contains logic for data ingestion, analysis, and presentation.
- **Controller**: Configured in `urls.py`, defines URL patterns and routes requests to appropriate views.

## Implementation Details

### Data Import

- Users upload a CSV file containing scientific data through the web interface.
- Django's file upload mechanism handles file submission.
- Upon submission, the application parses the CSV file, validates the data, and stores it in the SQLite database.

### Data Analysis

- A data analysis function, implemented in Python, calculates the average value for each observation type in each experiment.
- The results are stored in a dictionary format, facilitating easy access and manipulation.

### Data Presentation

- The analyzed data is presented on a web page using HTML templates.
- DataTables library is used to display tabular data, providing sorting and searching functionalities.
- JavaScript enhances frontend interactivity, enabling dynamic updates without page reloads.

## Testing

- Unit tests ensure the accuracy of the data analysis function.
- Integration tests verify the functionality of data ingestion and presentation components.
- Django's testing framework is utilized for writing and running tests.
